unRamalak and Gmf Installation
========================

Unramalak will be (one day...) a online js/php game. The goal is to kill, Unramalak, the giant Calmar, who takes the control of the universe.
First you will be on your planet, with a classic hexagonal map, where you can move and attack with your units, in a tactical game mode.

For now it's still in construction... You can see the roadmap to look for evolutions

Current version : Flower bamboo
Next version : Working Panda (soon...)
